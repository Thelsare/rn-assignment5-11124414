The app is a mobile application developed using React Native, which is a framework for creating cross-platform mobile apps. The app features two primary screens: a Home screen and a Settings screen.

The screen is thoughtfully organized into distinct sections, featuring a captivating header with a personalized profile image, a warm welcome message, and a convenient search icon. Positioned below the header is the eye-catching card image, accompanied by a scrollable list of transactions for easy browsing.
